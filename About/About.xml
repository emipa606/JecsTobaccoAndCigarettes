Why are my gruff colonists getting high on smokeleaf? Whatever happened to tobacco, you might ask. Well, now your colonists can finally grow and harvest tobacco plants. Just like with smokeleaf joints, cigarettes can be crafted at any crafting spot. Have fun!

[h1]1.2 Cigar Update![/h1]
Now you can add cigars to your list of smokables in RimWorld. If you have chocolate, you can sell a far more marketable 'chocolate cigar' to your loyal costumers.
